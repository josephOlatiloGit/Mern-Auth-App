MERN Stack Authentication Web App with OAuth
Overview

This project is a full-stack authentication web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The application leverages Google OAuth 2.0 for secure user authentication. Tailwind CSS is used for styling, ensuring a modern and responsive user interface.
Features

    User Authentication: Users can log in securely using their Google account.
    OAuth 2.0 Integration: The application integrates with Google OAuth 2.0, providing a secure and straightforward login experience.
    Responsive Design: The application is styled using Tailwind CSS, ensuring it looks great on all devices.
    Scalable Architecture: The MERN stack ensures the application is scalable and maintainable.

Project Structure

    Backend:
        Node.js & Express.js: Serve as the backend, handling API requests and managing sessions.
        MongoDB: Stores user data securely.
        Passport.js: Used to handle Google OAuth authentication.

    Frontend:
        React.js: Provides a dynamic and responsive user interface.
        Tailwind CSS: Ensures the application is styled beautifully and responsively.

Flow of Authentication

    User Clicks Login: The user clicks the "Login with Google" button on the login page.
    Google OAuth Prompt: The user is redirected to the Google OAuth page, where they can sign in using their Google account.
    Authentication Callback: Upon successful login, Google redirects the user back to the application with an authentication token.
    Token Verification: The backend verifies the token, and the user session is created.
    User Dashboard: The user is redirected to their dashboard or the protected area of the application.

Best Practices Followed

    Modular Code: The project is organized into modules, separating concerns between different functionalities.
    Proper Error Handling: Both client and server errors are handled gracefully, ensuring a smooth user experience.
    Security: User data is stored securely in MongoDB, and OAuth tokens are handled using best practices to ensure security.
    Documentation & Comments: The code is thoroughly documented, with comments explaining the logic and flow at crucial points.

    Conclusion

This project showcases a secure and efficient way to implement user authentication using Google OAuth in a MERN stack application. It follows best coding practices, ensuring the code is modular, maintainable, and easy to understand.
